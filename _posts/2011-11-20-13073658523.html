title: Unnatural languages?
---

<p><span>&#8220;The linguistic relativity principle, or the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, is the idea that differences in the way languages encode cultural and cognitive categories affect the way people think, so that speakers of different languages will tend to think and behave differently depending on the language they use.&#8221; © <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">Wikipedia</a><br/><br/>Is it really true? What about many developers that work and &#8220;think&#8221; on 2 or 3 different languages?<br/>Or these languages are unnatural, so people use them as just an expression tool to encode their mother language?<br/>I think the way you write your code is the way you think and behave. If I see a mess of unreadable code I come to the conclusion that there is complete chaous in the mind of guy who wrote it.</span></p>
